           17 May 2023. Moving day. Spent hours of 9 â€“ 1 waiting for moving company- they came shortly after 1. Chaos. 
           Had to walk my + half of Elle's boxes down the stairs. All successful though. Then to lunch w/ Elle. Brought 
           some stuff to the 2L apartment, back to the dorm, then back to apt intersection to give pillows to someone.
           Checked out of dorm, then Paul stopped by to say goodbye. Said goodbye to Luna too, then to Aunt Shannon's.
           Dropped stuff. Dinner nearby w/ Elle, Lily, Ava, and Ava's mom Stacy. Back to apartment. Talked w/ Shannon
           and David. Then bed.

            5 November 2023.  Woke up after another night of sleeping like a rock. Went downstairs and got started on breakfast.
            Ate with everyone. Then we cleaned up the place before Paul, Lily, Eli, and I left for the train station- Paul drove.
            I texted Gabi on the way. Rushed to catch the next train leaving (bye Eli)- made it. Sweet ride back listening to 
            Arthur Russell. Got home, went for a run. Then hung out with Lily for a bit. Elle home, we caught up. Then bed.

            briefly. Class ended early, then met Cali and walked home together. Did work/laundry, then watched Nathan Fielder.
